# Fictional Character Sexual Content Compliance Guidelines

> **Document Version:** 1.0.3  
> **Release Date:** November 23rd, 2025  
> **License:** GPL-3.0  

---

A consolidated set of standards designed to help animators, game developers, writers, and other creators avoid producing content that could be interpreted as sexualised depictions of minors. These guidelines aim to reduce ambiguity, eliminate loopholes, and promote responsible creative practices.

This document is not intended to restrict adult content in general. Its sole purpose is to prevent the intentional or accidental creation of material that may resemble or be construed as child sexual content — particularly in stylised or fictional contexts where age may be unclear.

## Compliance Tools

### Compliance Declaration
```
This creative work complies with the Fictional Character Sexual Content Compliance
Guidelines (Version 1.0.3). All characters depicted in sexual or suggestive
contexts are confirmed to be adults (18+), meet species maturity requirements,
and exhibit adult-coded visual and behavioural traits.
More info at https://github.com/draftysumo/Fictional-Character-Sexual-Content-Compliance-Guidelines
```

### Compliance Badge
```
✓ Compliant with FCSCCG (v1.0.3)
```
*Optional: Display this badge in metadata, README, or credits.*

## Guideline I: Minimum Chronological Age
> Any character depicted in sexual contexts (explicit or implied) must have existed for at least **18 full real-world years**.

- Applies regardless of species, universe, biology, magic, or lore.  
- No exceptions based on fictional time, accelerated aging, or alternate timelines.

---

## Guideline II: Species Maturity + Human-Equivalent Age
> Non-human characters must meet **both** fictional and real-world adulthood criteria.

1. They must be considered an adult within their species.  
2. They must still be **at least 18 real-world years old**.  

- Being “of age” in their species alone is not sufficient.  
- Characters must satisfy *both* requirements simultaneously.

---

## Guideline III: Adult Presentation Requirements
> Characters must visually and behaviourally present as adults to avoid confusion or interpretation as minors.

- Should show adult physical proportions (if human/humanoid).  
- Should have mature/post-puberty voice characteristics (if voiced).  
- Should demonstrate adult-like reasoning, behaviour, and decision-making.  
- Optional: minor age cues can be included (e.g., slight aging), but are not required since art styles differ.

---

## Guideline IV: No Sexual Contexts Involving Minors
> Minors must not appear in, be present near, or be contextually connected to sexual content in any way.

- No minors in the scene.  
- No minors witnessing, overhearing, or discovering sexual content.  
- No framing where minors are nearby or implied to be involved.  
- No story setups that place minors close to sexual activity.

---

## Guideline V: Canonical Age Disclosure
> When a character’s age may be unclear, the creator must clearly establish that the character is an adult.

This applies especially when:  
- The art style is stylised (cartoon, chibi, heavily simplified).  
- The character visually appears young.  
- The world or setting makes ages ambiguous.

Acceptable forms of age clarification:  
- Character bios or sheets  
- Written age statements in accompanying text  
- Dialogue or story context confirming adulthood  
- Metadata or description fields

---

## Guideline VI: No Forced Age Ambiguity
> Creators must not intentionally make a character’s age unclear in ways that could imply youth.

Disallowed:  
- “They look young, but they’re actually 1,000 years old” loopholes  
- Leaving age unstated to create ambiguity  
- Designing characters to appear minor-coded but claiming adulthood without proof  

Age should be explicitly established when there is any risk of misinterpretation.

---

## Guideline VII: Setting & Theming Restrictions
> Avoid sexual depictions that take place in environments strongly associated with minors.

Prohibited settings include:  
- Primary schools  
- Daycares  
- Children’s playgrounds  
- Kids’ camps  
- Youth dormitories  
- Orphanages or foster-care environments  
- Bedrooms or living spaces designed for minors

Context alone can imply underage involvement.

## Creator Checklist
> Before publishing, confirm:

- [ ] All characters are 18+ real-world age  
- [ ] All non-human characters meet species + 18-year rule  
- [ ] No minor-like traits are used  
- [ ] No minor-coded settings, themes, or framing  
- [ ] Age is clearly stated for ambiguous designs  
- [ ] No forced ambiguity  
- [ ] Documented compliance is attached (optional but recommended)

## Definitions
> This section clarifies key terms used in the guidelines to ensure consistent interpretation.

- **Adult** – Any fictional character that meets the minimum age requirements (18+ real-world years) and is depicted with adult-coded features appropriate to their species.  
- **Adult-Coded** – Visual, behavioural, or narrative traits that clearly indicate adulthood, e.g., body proportions, mature voice, clothing, social roles, autonomy, reasoning.  
- **Implied Sexual Content** – Scenarios where sexual activity is not shown directly but is clearly suggested or inferred.  
- **Minor** – Any character under 18 real-world years or with minor-coded traits (childlike proportions, behaviour, or context) regardless of fictional age.  
- **Minor-Coded Traits** – Traits associated with children or youth that may make a character appear underage.  
- **Prohibited Contexts/Settings** – Environments strongly associated with minors (schools, playgrounds, daycares, youth camps, orphanages, bedrooms designed for minors).  
- **Sexual Context** – Any scene, depiction, or narrative involving sexual activity, suggestion, or sexualised behaviour.  
- **Species Maturity** – A character is considered mature according to their species’ natural adult development, in addition to real-world age.

## How to Verify a Character’s Age
> Steps to ensure compliance and provide evidence that characters meet adult requirements.

1. **Review Guidelines** – Ensure all previous sections are considered.  
2. **Establish Real-World Chronological Age** – Confirm the character has lived at least 18 real-world years and document it.  
3. **Confirm Species Maturity** – For non-human characters, verify adult status in their species.  
4. **Check Visual and Behavioural Adult-Coding** – Confirm adult body proportions, clothing, voice, reasoning, and decision-making.  
5. **Avoid Minor-Coded Traits** – Remove or adjust any traits that could suggest underage appearance.  
6. **Provide Canonical Age Confirmation** – Include age in character sheets, story text, dialogue, metadata, or credits.  
7. **Document Verification** – Keep internal records or notes confirming compliance.  
8. **Review Context** – Ensure scene and setting do not imply minor involvement.  
9. **Optional Peer Review** – Have another creator or reviewer confirm adult characteristics, especially for stylized designs.
