# Fictional Character Sexual Content Compliance Guidelines.
> **Document Version:** 1.0.0  
> **Release Date:** November 23rd, 2025  
> **License:** GPL-3.0  

---
  
A consolidated set of standards designed to help animators, game developers, writers, and other creators avoid producing content that could be interpreted as sexualised depictions of minors. These guidelines aim to reduce ambiguity, eliminate loopholes, and promote responsible creative practices.

This document is not intended to restrict adult content in general. Its sole purpose is to prevent the intentional or accidental creation of material that may resemble or be construed as child sexual content — particularly in stylised or fictional contexts where age may be unclear.

### Compliance Declaration
```
This creative work complies with the Fictional Character Sexual Content Compliance
Guidelines (Version 1.0.0). All characters depicted in sexual or suggestive
contexts are confirmed to be adults (18+), meet species maturity requirements,
and exhibit adult-coded visual and behavioural traits.

**Complience Badge:**

✓ Compliant with FCSCCG (v1.0.0)

### Guideline I: Minimum Chronological Age
> Any character depicted in sexual contexts (explicit or implied) must have existed
> for at least **18 full real-world years**.
- This applies regardless of species, universe, biology, magic, or lore.
- No exceptions based on fictional time, accelerated aging, or alternate timelines.

---

### Guideline II: Species Maturity + Human-Equivalent Age
> Non-human characters must meet **both** fictional and real-world adulthood criteria.
1. They must be considered an adult within their species.
2. They must still be **at least 18 real-world years old**.
- Being “of age” in their species alone is not enough.
- Characters must satisfy *both* requirements simultaneously.

---

### Guideline III: Adult Presentation Requirements
> Characters must visually and behaviourally present as adults to avoid confusion
> or interpretation as minors.
- Should show adult physical proportions (if human/humanoid).
- Should have mature/post-puberty voice characteristics (if voiced).
- Should demonstrate adult-like reasoning, behaviour, and decision-making.
- Optional: minor age cues can be included (e.g., slight aging), but are not required
  since art styles differ.

---

### Guideline IIII: No Sexual Contexts Involving Minors
> Minors must not appear in, be present near, or be contextually connected to
> sexual content in any way.

- No minors in the scene.
- No minors witnessing, overhearing, or discovering the sexual content.
- No framing where minors are nearby or implied to be involved.
- No story setups that place minors close to sexual activity.

---

### Guideline V: Canonical Age Disclosure
> When a character’s age may be unclear, the creator must clearly establish that
> the character is an adult.

This applies especially when:
- The art style is stylised (cartoon, chibi, heavily simplified).
- The character visually appears young.
- The world or setting makes ages ambiguous.

Acceptable forms of age clarification:
- Character bios or sheets
- Written age statements in accompanying text
- Dialogue or story context confirming adulthood
- Metadata or description fields

---

### Guideline VI: No Forced Age Ambiguity
> Creators must not intentionally make a character’s age unclear in ways that
> could imply youth.

Disallowed:
- “They look young, but they’re actually 1,000 years old” loopholes
- Leaving age unstated to create ambiguity
- Designing characters to appear minor-coded but claiming adulthood without proof

Age should be explicitly established when there is any risk of misinterpretation.

---

### Guideline VII: Setting & Theming Restrictions
> Avoid sexual depictions that take place in environments strongly associated
> with minors.

Prohibited settings include:
- Primary schools
- Daycares
- Children’s playgrounds
- Kids’ camps
- Youth dormitories
- Orphanages or foster-care environments
- Bedrooms or living spaces designed for minors

Context alone can imply underage involvement.

---

### Creator Checklist
> Before publishing, confirm:

- All characters are 18+ real-world age

- All non-human characters meet species + 18-year rule

- No minor-like traits are used

- No minor-coded settings, themes, or framing

- Age is clearly stated for ambiguous designs

- No forced ambiguity

- Documented compliance is attached (optional but recommended)

## Definitions

> This section clarifies key terms used in the guidelines to ensure consistent interpretation.

- **Adult** – Any fictional character that meets the minimum age requirements (18+ real-world years) and is depicted with adult-coded features appropriate to their species.

- **Minor** – Any character under the age of 18 real-world years, or any character with minor-coded features (childlike proportions, behaviour, or context) regardless of the story’s fictional age.

- **Adult-Coded** – Visual, behavioural, or narrative traits that clearly indicate adulthood. This includes body proportions, mature voice, clothing, social roles, autonomy, and reasoning typical of adults.

- **Sexual Context** – Any scene, depiction, or narrative situation that includes sexual activity, sexual suggestion, or sexualised behaviour. This includes explicit sexual acts, implied sexual situations, or sexually suggestive imagery.

- **Implied Sexual Content** – Scenarios where sexual activity is not shown directly but is clearly suggested or inferred.

- **Species Maturity** – A fictional character is considered mature according to the natural adult developmental standards of their species, in addition to meeting real-world age requirements.

- **Minor-Coded Traits** – Traits typically associated with children or youth, such as childlike body proportions, facial features, behaviour, or clothing, which could cause a character to appear underage.

- **Prohibited Contexts/Settings** – Environments strongly associated with minors, such as schools, playgrounds, daycares, youth camps, orphanages, or bedrooms designed for minors.


## How to Verify a Character’s Age

> These steps help creators ensure compliance with the guidelines and provide evidence of adult status for characters depicted in sexual contexts.

1. **Establish Real-World Chronological Age**
   - Confirm the character has lived at least 18 real-world years.
   - Document this in character sheets, story notes, or metadata.

2. **Confirm Species Maturity**
   - For non-human characters, verify they are considered adults by their species’ natural development standards.
   - Document how species maturity aligns with the 18-year real-world rule.

3. **Check Visual and Behavioural Adult-Coding**
   - Ensure characters display adult-coded traits:
     - Body proportions  
     - Clothing or attire consistent with adults  
     - Mature voice (if voiced)  
     - Reasoning, decision-making, and autonomy typical of adults  

4. **Avoid Minor-Coded Traits**
   - Remove or adjust traits that could suggest the character is underage.
   - Review facial features, body proportions, mannerisms, and clothing.

5. **Provide Canonical Age Confirmation**
   - Include the character’s age in:
     - Character sheets or reference documents  
     - Story text or dialogue  
     - Metadata, credits, or accompanying descriptions  

6. **Document Verification**
   - Keep records demonstrating the above steps have been applied.
   - This can be used for internal review, publication notes, or as part of a compliance declaration.

7. **Review Context**
   - Ensure settings and scene context do not imply minor involvement.
   - Avoid placing characters in environments strongly associated with minors.

8. **Optional Peer Review**
   - Have another creator or reviewer confirm the character meets all adult criteria.
   - Especially recommended for stylized or ambiguous art styles.
